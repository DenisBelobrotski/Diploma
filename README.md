# Magnetic fluid form proplem solution
This repository is my bachelor degree project.
## Description
### Work includes
During the work, an equation is considered for finding the equilibrium form of a magnetic fluid, considering the non-uniform concentration of magnetic particles in the carrier fluid. Considering the boundary conditions, a boundary value problem has been constructed, which solution is found using numerical methods. Two difference schemes for solving the problem and the corresponding algorithms were developed. A comparative analysis of the numerical results calculated with and without considering uniform concentration is also made. In addition, a comparison of the numerical results calculated by different algorithms, as well as the influence of the main input parameters on equilibrium shapes of a magnetic liquid are considered.  
### Work result
The result of the work are two algorithms for the numerical solution of the problem of the effect of the concentration of particles in a magnetic fluid on its equilibrium form in the non-uniform magnetic field of a vertical conductor.  
Algorithms:
- Finite-difference method
- Tangential method
